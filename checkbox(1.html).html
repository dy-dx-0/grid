        </p><p style="margin-top:5px"> Scotland's digital skills academy may be revived as a college-based course less than a year after its innovative predecessor went into liquidation.
        The CodeClan name and brand have been acquired by CodeBase, the Scottish government's contractor for its £42m TechScaler programme to support start-up businesses and entrepreneurs.
        Teaching will be delivered by San Francisco-based online provider Owasar.
        A spokesman for CodeBase said the pilot scheme would involve training staff from three Scottish colleges - Edinburgh College, Borders College, and West Lothian College.
        It is hoped that students will become part of the next phase of the pilot in 2025, he said.
